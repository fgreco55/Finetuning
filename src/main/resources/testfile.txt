Hope everyone soaked up some serious summer vibes! Now, get ready to bask in the awesomeness of our phenomenal autumn and join us for a dazzling NYJavaSIG extravaganza, teaming up with our pals from the GSJUG. Our lovable
nerd party is all about the release of Java 21, which brings a wave of mind-blowing new features that will completely transform how you write Java code.
There are virtual threads and structured concurrency, where data manipulation becomes a breeze with enhanced efficiency and elegance. You'll see the magic of disappearing records, adding a touch of simplicity and
sophistication to your codebase like never before. Brace yourself as we explore the mind-boggling possibilities of reversing collections, opening up a whole new realm of
data manipulation and analysis. And if you are a new developer looking to enter the Java ecosystem, Java 21 has an upgraded "Hello World" experience carefully curated just for you.
Join us at the joint NYJavaSIG/GSJUG meeting on Wed, September 13, hosted by BNY Mellon, for an unforgettable journey into the extraordinary realm of Java 21. JCP Executive Committee members from major
enterprises (Amazon, Microsoft, BNYM, Red Hat, BellSoft, Microdoc, SouJava)  share valuable insights on adopting this groundbreaking release and reveal their favorite features.
Let's toast the 25-year anniversary of the JCP and learn about the incredible new features in Java 21 together.   Please REGISTER for the in-person NYJavaSIG event ASAP!
